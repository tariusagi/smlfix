This little utility run as a Windows service and do the followings:

- Modify the Smartlaunch Client.inf file to set the correct ComputerNumber
  and ComputerName using the current IP.
- Monitor the Smartlaunch client process. If this process is terminated 
  and does not come back within 10 seconds, the the system will reboot.

The smlfix.ini in the %WINDIR%\system32 folder contains the path to the 
Smartlaunch client folder. The default path is "C:\Program Files\
Smartlaunch\Client" (DO NOT INCLUDE any the trailing slash). If it's not
correct, then feel free to modify it and restart the "smlfix" service to
update the value.

During its service time, Smartlaunch Fix log all information into the 
"%WINDIR%\system32\smlfix.log" file. You can view this file using any 
text viewer.
